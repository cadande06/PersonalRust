    STACK AND HEAP- PART of the RAM(random access memory)
    Whenever we run a program, we need some space on the RAM to store the data of our program and we want it to be easily accessible don't want duplicate data.Also, when we aren't using a variable or we have already used it and have no use of it anymore, we want it removed from RAM.
    Wehave Stack and Heap in Rust
    RUST STACK - the most recent walua added would be the first to be removed because it's at the top. LIFO - Last In First Out. FILO - First In Last Out. Stach is the fastest piece of RAM in Rust.We try to use the stack as much as possible.
    RUST HEAP - heap is used when we need more space. If you need to allocate a large block of memory (e.g. a large array, or a big struct), and you need to keep that variable around a long time (like a global), use the heap.
